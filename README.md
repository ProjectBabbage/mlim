# MLim

ML improved experience.

Bringing the necessary maths to life as a programming language, so you can iterate fast during the making of your ML models.
Similar to a Jupyter notebook, share both the theory and code, without uncoupling the two !

# Installation

You need to install python3.8+ and node 16+. Then, wether you are using poetry or not, `make` to install compiler and frontend dependencies.

# Run
At the root of the project:

`chmod +x mlim.sh`

Then :
`./mlim.sh --run` or simply `-r`

`./mlim.sh --help` gives you the list of options of the `mlim.sh` script.
For example, run all the tests with:
`./mlim.sh --tests`
